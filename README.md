Manforest Cafe Website

Hello Welcome to README

In this file, here are the information about the website "Manforest Cafe". I am Kisha J. Mangubat, the developer of Manforest Cafe website. Hoping that you will like and enjoy this simple responsive website I have created.

About the Website: I name this website after my surname which is Mangubat and translate it into Manforest that is why it is Manforest Cafe. The reason why I create this kind of website is because I love coffee and ever since I want to have my own cafe someday. Thinking that I sould have my own cafe in the future I would love to create and design my own website by appying my learnings about CSS, HTML and BOOTSTRAP. This website is simply a website for coffee lovers where they can view our menu, gallary and contact us if they would like to.

CSS Framework - Bootstrap 5.2.3 

Other components - Java Script 

Responsiveness - It is a responsive website that could scale in any screen size. 

Optimization - It's not perfect but good enough I think.
